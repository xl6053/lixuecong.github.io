 Li Xuecong Now is doing Ph.D study in University of Lisbon/Institute of systems and robots Lisbon
 The initial motivation for his research idea was to design a user-friendly human-computer interaction paradigm for 3D Appearance Authoring based on Gaussion splatting. The goal was to allow for semantically-unconstrained scribbling on 2D images (such as applying custom textures or markings), thereby addressing the core problems of geometric ambiguity and limited creative freedom.
